          <h2>Poverty Rates: Obesity vs Smoking</h2>
          <p>Most people are aware that smoking causes cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other disorders. Over the past several decades, the media have extensively covered the medical problems associated with nicotine and tobacco. However, since 2005, obesity is now killing people at a higher rate than smoking.</p>

          <p>Statistically speaking, obesity is also more damaging to a person’s health than immoderate alcohol consumption or even living in poverty. Extreme obesity increases your risk of suffering from strokes, heart disease, and various forms of cancer. It also makes it likelier that you will acquire type 2 diabetes.</p>

          <p>In short, if you’re 30 years old and morbidly obese, it’s as though you have the body of an average 50-year-old. If you’re morbidly obese and a smoker, it is even worse for you and you are causing even more harm to your health.</p>
